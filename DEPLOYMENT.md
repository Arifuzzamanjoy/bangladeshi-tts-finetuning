# Bangladeshi TTS Model Deployment Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive deployment strategy for the fine-tuned Bangladeshi Bangla XTTS v2 model, covering production packaging, optimization techniques, and scalable serving architecture optimized for real-world applications.

## Model Packaging

### Core Components
The deployment package consists of:
- **Model Weights**: Fine-tuned XTTS v2 checkpoint (`.pth` file, ~2.1GB)
- **Configuration**: Model configuration (`config.json`) with training parameters and audio processing settings
- **Dependencies**: Complete `requirements.txt` with pinned versions for reproducible deployments
- **Text Processing**: Bengali text normalization utilities (`normalize_bangla_text()` function)
- **Speaker Encoding**: Reference speaker audio processing pipeline with voice cloning capabilities
- **Evaluation Framework**: AccentEvaluator for quality monitoring in production

### Docker Containerization Strategy
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimized image size
FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Production stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install runtime dependencies only
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ffmpeg \
    libsndfile1 \
    libgomp1 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy Python packages from builder
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code and model
COPY model/ ./model/
COPY src/ ./src/
COPY config.json .

# Create non-root user for security
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash app
RUN chown -R app:app /app
USER app

# Health check endpoint
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run with optimized settings
CMD ["python", "-OO", "src/api_server.py"]
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Production environment variables
export TTS_MODEL_PATH="/app/model/best_checkpoint.pth"
export TTS_CONFIG_PATH="/app/config.json"
export TTS_CACHE_DIR="/app/cache"
export TTS_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export TTS_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS="4"
export TTS_ENABLE_GPU="true"
```

## 2. Inference Optimization

For real-time applications, inference latency is critical. The default PyTorch model can be optimized for faster performance.

**Export to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange):**
The most effective optimization is to export the PyTorch model to the ONNX format. This decouples the model from the Python-heavy training framework and allows it to be run by highly optimized inference engines.

**Benefits of ONNX:**
- **Performance**: ONNX Runtime provides significant speed-ups (up to 2-3x) over native PyTorch inference by leveraging hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., TensorRT on NVIDIA GPUs, OpenVINO on Intel CPUs).
- **Portability**: An ONNX model can be run in various environments (C++, C#, Java) without a Python dependency.
- **Reduced Footprint**: The inference engine has a much smaller footprint than the full PyTorch library.

The process involves tracing the model with example inputs and using the `torch.onnx.export()` function. This can be complex for models like XTTS and may require modifications to the model's forward pass to make it traceable.

## 3. Resource Requirements

The hardware required depends on the target latency and request volume.

**GPU vs. CPU:**
- **GPU (Recommended for Low Latency)**: A GPU like an NVIDIA T4 or L4 is ideal for real-time, interactive use cases. It will provide the lowest latency (<1 second for short sentences).
  - **VRAM Requirement**: The XTTS v2 model requires approximately 2-3 GB of VRAM for inference, making even entry-level data center GPUs suitable.
- **CPU**: CPU inference is significantly slower and may not be suitable for interactive applications. However, it is a cheaper option for offline batch processing tasks (e.g., generating audio for a podcast).

**Low-Resource Environments (Edge Devices):**
For deployment on edge devices, further optimization is necessary:
- **Model Quantization**: Converting the model's weights from 32-bit floating-point (FP32) to 8-bit integers (INT8). This reduces the model size by ~4x and can significantly speed up CPU inference. Both ONNX Runtime and PyTorch support quantization.
- **Model Pruning/Distillation**: More advanced techniques to reduce the model size and complexity, which would require a separate research and training phase.

## 4. Serving Strategy

A robust serving architecture is needed to expose the model as a scalable and reliable service.

**API using FastAPI:**
We will wrap the inference logic in a **FastAPI** microservice. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

- **Endpoint**: Create a RESTful API endpoint (e.g., `/synthesize`) that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the `text` and a `speaker_wav` file (e.g., base64-encoded).
- **Response**: The endpoint will return the synthesized audio, either as a file download (`audio/wav`) or as a base64-encoded string in a JSON response.

**Scalability:**
The FastAPI service, containerized with Docker, can be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or a Kubernetes cluster).

- **Load Balancing**: Place a load balancer in front of the service to distribute incoming requests across multiple container instances.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling rules to automatically launch more container instances based on CPU/GPU utilization or the number of incoming requests. This ensures the service can handle fluctuating traffic.

**Streaming Synthesis (Advanced):**
For long-form text (e.g., articles or book chapters), waiting for the entire audio to be generated can lead to high perceived latency. A streaming approach provides a much better user experience.

- **Implementation**: The model would need to be modified or wrapped to generate audio in chunks.
- **API**: The FastAPI endpoint can be designed to support streaming responses (e.g., using `StreamingResponse`). As audio chunks are generated, they are immediately sent back to the client.
- **Client-side**: The client application would need to be able to receive and buffer these chunks to play them back seamlessly.

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance solution for serving the fine-tuned TTS model in a production environment.
